**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A multi-page frontend-only React application has been created with pages for Home, About, Projects, People, Tech Stack, Investors, and Contact. The entire application is styled with Tailwind CSS and a global  file. All content and image URLs are hardcoded in a mock data file (). The project has undergone several major, iterative, and user-driven redesigns, with the core focus being on finding a specific visual aesthetic that blends nature and technology imagery.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was executing another major redesign based on very specific user feedback (message #149). The new design requires:
    1.  Page backgrounds to use a combination of three types of Himachal Pradesh scenery: snow-capped mountains, rivers, and forests.
    2.  Cards to have solid color backgrounds with clearly legible text.
    3.  AI/robot images to be used only as small accent images *inside* the cards, not as card backgrounds.
    The agent had acknowledged the request, gathered new images, and started reorganizing the  file to separate nature images from AI images.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** The website's visual design does not meet the user's specific and frequently updated aesthetic requirements. (Priority: P0)

    **Issues Detail:**
    -   **Issue 1:**
        -   **Description:** The user has rejected multiple design iterations. The latest, most critical feedback requires a complete layout change where page backgrounds are exclusively for nature scenery, while cards are solid-colored with small tech-themed accent images inside them.
        -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has implemented at least four distinct, full-site redesigns in this session alone: 1) Large mountain backgrounds with text overlays, 2) Blended nature/tech imagery with tech logos, 3) A crystal clear HD version with a special headline effect, 4) A version with card backgrounds and blur effects. All were ultimately rejected or modified by the user, leading to the current task.
        -   **Next debug checklist:**
            1.  Finish updating  to correctly categorize nature (mountains, rivers, forests) and AI/robot images.
            2.  Modify  to support solid-color cards and remove styles that use images as card backgrounds.
            3.  Rewrite all page components (, , etc.) to implement the new structure: page-level nature backgrounds, sections with solid-color cards, and small AI accent images placed *within* those cards.
            4.  Verify the new design across all pages using the .
        -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To finally satisfy the user's aesthetic requirements, which is the primary blocker preventing any further progress on the project (e.g., backend development).
        -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
        -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
        -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
        -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Complete the site-wide visual redesign as per the latest user instructions. (Priority: P0)

    **Task Detail:**
    -   **Task 1:**
        -   **Where to resume:** The agent was in the middle of editing . The next step is to update the site's CSS and then apply the new design logic to all React page components.
        -   **What will be achieved with this?** A website design that aligns with the user's explicit instructions, finally resolving the long-standing design blocker.
        -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
        -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
        -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Task 1: Backend Integration (P1):** Once the design is approved, the next major phase is to build a backend.
        -   Define API endpoints in a  file.
        -   Develop MongoDB models for projects, team members, etc.
        -   Implement CRUD API endpoints in FastAPI.
        -   Replace all mock data in the frontend with live data from the API.
    -   **Task 2: Functional Contact Form (P1):** Implement the backend logic to make the contact form operational.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Performed multiple full-site redesigns, iterating on backgrounds, overlays, card styles, and image selection.
-   Fixed a runtime error on the  page caused by a faulty  handler.
-   Updated the company name to Globistaan Technologies and Exports Private Limited and a section title from Technology Partners to Tools We Use.
-   Implemented a text-clipping CSS effect for the Where Mountains Meet Machines headline.
-   Added actual logos for technologies on the Tech Stack page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All efforts have been focused on the single recurring design issue.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork:** The user's dissatisfaction with the visual design is a major recurring issue that has carried over and dominated this entire session, causing multiple full redesigns.
-   **Recurrence count:** High (at least 4 major redesigns in this session).
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (planned, not yet implemented).
-   **Database:** MongoDB (planned, not yet implemented).
-   **Architecture:** Static frontend with mocked data.

**key DB schema**
-   No application-specific schemas have been defined yet.

**changes in tech stack**
-   None in this session.

**All files of reference**
-   : All page components, which have been repeatedly rewritten.
-   : Contains all hardcoded data and image URLs; has been modified multiple times.
-   : Contains global styles, animations, and card designs; has been heavily modified throughout the session.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file has undergone significant churn with multiple redesigns and likely contains redundant or conflicting CSS rules. It should be cleaned up once the final design is approved.
-   All data is hardcoded in  and needs to be replaced by API calls during backend integration.

**key api endpoints**
-   None are currently implemented or used by the application.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly specific about the visual design and the project is stuck in a design-feedback loop.
-   Your **only priority** is to implement the user's latest request from message #149 *exactly* as described. Do not introduce new creative elements.
-   The required formula is: Page Background = (Mountains + Rivers + Forests). Cards = (Solid Color Background + Clear Text + Small AI/Robot Accent Image).
-   Do not proceed to backend work until the user explicitly approves the new design.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-   : Was created/updated, but likely reflects a previous, now-rejected design. It must be updated again after the current task is completed and approved.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   **User (latest #149):** Please use a combination of 3 images - snowcapped/green mountains, rivers and forests from himachal pradesh in all pages. the robot and ai agent images shoudl be in a small section in all the cards - the cards themselved shoudl have a color background and clearly legible text. (IN PROGRESS)
-   **Agent (#150-152):** Acknowledged the new design rules and began implementation by sourcing images and updating .
-   **User (#120):** Please do not use any blurred images in background 0- i need ot see clear high definiation natural images... Also Where Mountains Meet Machines - this line should have asome sort of effect... (COMPLETED in the last iteration, but the design was still rejected).
-   **Agent (#121-145):** Implemented the clear HD image and special headline effect redesign.
-   **User (#89):** We dont have any technology partenrs... please dont use blurred backgrounds... Getting runtime error in tech stack page - fix it. (COMPLETED)
-   **Agent (#90-116):** Fixed the runtime error, removed blur, and updated text as requested.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The visual design is misaligned with the user's specific requirements, making it functionally broken from their perspective.
-   **Mocked:** The entire application's data layer is mocked in . The backend is completely disconnected.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Unsplash:** Used informally via agent web search to source background images. No formal API integration exists.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** The visual design has repeatedly failed to meet user expectations, forcing multiple redesigns.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has been unable to start backend work (e.g., creating ) because all development effort has been consumed by the user's continuous and iterative frontend design requests. This is a deliberate prioritization based on user feedback, not an oversight.</analysis>
